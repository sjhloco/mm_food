## Notes

Things to improve next time.

-Maybe a little bit of chilli flakes in with the flour to give it a bit of a kick
-I used 4 thighs and 3 mini-fillets. The thighs were nice because of the skin, however the  bones are a bit of a pain. Mini-fillets are not good as they cook too quick
-Be more careful with cream next time, add gradually and taste as don't want it too creamy
-Didn't have spinach or parmesan, try next time soo it it improves it
